# PHP Algorithms

Here I will add a handful of algorithms from many fields I find useful and interesting.

## Euclidean (aka GCD)

GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor.  
Given 2 natural numbers, find their greatest common divisor that divides both of them without leaving any reminder.  
> Time Complexity: O(log min(a, b))

## Euclidean Extended (aka GCD Extended)

Same as the Euclidean algorithm but this algorithm also brings us 2 numbers `x,y` that satisfy the following equation:  
`gcd(a, b) = ax + by = d`  
> Time Complexity: O(log min(a, b))

## Kadane (aka Maximum Subarray Problem)

Finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array.  
> Time Complexity: O(n)

## Binary Search

Finds the position (index) of a target value within a sorted array.  
> Time Complexity: O(log n)

## Insertion Sort

Simple sorting algorithm.  
> Time Complexity: O(n^2)

## String Sum

Given 2 big natural numbers, sum them together.  
> Time Complexity: O(max(|str1|, |str2|))
